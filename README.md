Flight Simulation Control:

Our client's company provides sets for converting light aircraft into autonomous ones.
The client's request is to build a cloud-based system for remote control of their aircraft fleet.

In order to perform the request we will separate our project to 3 main parts: 
Agent- Each flight will have an agent. The Agent will collect information about the activity of the Aircraft and transmit commands.
Server (Backend)- Will store data from the Aircraft fleet on the DB server and provide managed access.
Client (Frontend)- Will present all the information about the flights like monitor panel and a map.
